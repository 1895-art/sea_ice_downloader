Sea Ice Concentration Downloader V1.0.0
=======================================

##What it does
This is a QGIS Plugin which allows easy download of sea ice concentration data from [NSIDC](http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/) (National Snow and Ice Data Centre). 

It downloads daily sea ice concentration grids within a defined time range as well as an optional averaged composite. The data is saved in GeoTiff format, to Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection (EPSG: 3031). 

The Plugin is currently working, but has not been subject to wide use. Therefore, there may be problems with it. 


##The data
